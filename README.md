React App
Overview
This is a React application designed with a well-structured folder layout for screens, hooks, and constants. The app uses modern best practices for separation of concerns, ensuring that logic, styles, and constants are modular and reusable.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Latest version (Ensure you have the latest Node.js version installed. You can download it from here).
npm: Comes pre-installed with Node.js.
How to Run the Project

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Project Structure
Follow the project structure outlined below for screens, hooks, constants, and styles.

Folder Structure
bash
Copy code
├── src
│   ├── screens
│   │   └── ScreenName
│   │       ├── index.jsx          # Main component file for the screen
│   │       ├── style.js           # Styles specific to the screen
│   │       ├── constants.js       # Screen-specific constants
│   │
│   ├── hooks                      # Folder for custom hooks
│   │   ├── useCustomHook.js
│   │
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── index.css              # Generic/global styles
│   │
│   ├── App.js                     # Main entry file for React
│   ├── index.js                   # Main entry point for the app
│   └── ...
Screens
Each screen will have its own folder inside src/screens/. Inside the screen folder, you should have:

index.jsx: The main JSX component for the screen.
style.js: A file to define all styles specific to the screen.
constants.js: A file for storing screen-specific constants, such as labels, API endpoints, or static values.
Hooks
All custom hooks should be placed in the src/hooks/ folder. Hooks handle the logic of the application separately, which improves the reusability and readability of the code.

Generic Styles
index.css: All generic/global styles should be placed in this file. If you need to apply any global styles across the app, define them here.
Branches
Main Branch: main
All major changes and production code should be merged into the main branch.
Example of a Screen Folder:
bash
Copy code
src/screens/Home/
├── index.jsx          # Home screen component
├── style.js           # Styles for Home screen
├── constants.js       # Constants used in Home screen
Example of Using Custom Hook:
jsx
Copy code
// In src/screens/Home/index.jsx
import { useHomeLogic } from '../../hooks/useHomeLogic';

function Home() {
  const { data, handleClick } = useHomeLogic();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Screen</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
Note
If you're adding any new generic styles, make sure to include them in the index.css file to maintain consistency across the app.

This structure should help keep your project clean, modular, and scalable as it grows.
